@W: MT529 :"d:\isc\semestre 2021-1\arquitectura de computadoras\practicas\22_word00\word00\source\div00.vhd":22:2:22:3|Found inferred clock oscint00|osc_int0_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including CW01.C01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
